    "## Sizing of the aircraft\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part of this notebook, you will need to verify the sizing of your aircraft using FAST-OAD. To do so we will use a different way to compute the mission that the one used in the tutorials. In the tutorial, a simple Breguet formula was used, here we will use the mission file (It was possible to use it in the first tutorial, a comment made mention of it). This file allows you to describe segment after segment the mission you want your aircraft to fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. The mission file\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the mission module to compute the fuel consumption over a specified mission. Therefore, you need to define the different phases your mission is composed of. That operation is done through the YAML [mission file](./data/design_mission.yml). If you have a closer look to this file, you will notice that it starts with a definition of the different flight phases (initial climb, climb, descent, holding, taxi) for which one or several flight parameter(s) is (are) varying.\n",
    "\n",
    "For exemple, for the initial climb phase, the first segment is performed at iso-speed with a variation of altitude up to 400ft, then a second segment defines an acceleration at iso-altitude up to 250kt and a third segment at iso-speed and targetting an altitude of 15000ft completes this phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each phases are then organised and completed with a cruise phase to form a route. Several routes can then be combined to form a mission profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each mission profile should have a unique name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further information about the mission definition, please see the [official documentation](https://fast-oad.readthedocs.io/en/documentation/mission_module/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. The configuration file\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, the [configuration file](./data/oad_sizing.yml) you are using enables you run the full OAD sizing process. Here a particular attention is paid on the performance module definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, in this section, you will call the [mission file](./data/design_mission.yml) you want to use through the `mission_file_path` option. You will then indicate which mission profile to select accordingly to the naming convention you chose in the mission file. This is done using the `mission_name` option. In the present situation you will compute performances for the mission called `MTOW_mission`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the option `is_sizing` of the performance group is active. That means that the mission TOW computed by the performance module is considered as the design Maximum Take-Off Weight and will impact the aircraft design. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also notice that the option `add_solver` is deactivated as solvers are already defined for the whole problem in the [configuration file](./data/oad_sizing.yml)."

To find in which unit you must fill your values, we will first list the problem variables using the following cell. There might be some adjustement to make to find the right values on some parameters. For instance the thickness-to-chord ratio is omputed in FAST-OAD using a formula base on the cruise mach and wing sweep angle. This formula however uses empirical coefficient which depends a lot on the airfoil technology so it might be wrong for new and/or old aircraft. The cruise mach being an important design parameters, the sweep angle could be changed a little in this case."

For this part, we will reuse the [mission file](./data/design_mission.yml) from the first part but we will use a diffent [configuration file](./data/redesign_sizing.yml) so that we can change the name of the input and output file.\n",
